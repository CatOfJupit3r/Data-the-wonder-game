# Data-the-wonder-game
This repository contains a discord bot that I developed at the request of a dear friend of mine, who is also the creator of The Wonder Game.
If you want to use this repository, you need to have a discord bot token, which you can get from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
You also need to install requirements.txt, as well as create a file called .env, which will contain the following:

```dotenv
DISCORD_API_TOKEN='*your token*'
ADMIN_ID='*your id*'
```

I AM NOT THE CREATOR OF THE WONDER GAME, I AM JUST A DEVELOPER OF THE BOT AND HIS DEAR FRIEND.

I am not responsible for any problems that may occur during usage of bot, I am just a man who loves to create cool stuff.
All phrases are completely random and are not related to any real people, organizations or event that have occurred or may occur...
I am in no way associated with the phrases used by this bot
